Our company has gone under a massive safety lighting project throughout our entire railroad line and Entergy has been there step by step. Entergy has been extremely helpful both on the phone and in meeting me at numerous locations in completing this project. From the Customer Service representatives, to the managers, to the lineman; all have been A+ individuals and I recommend Entergy for anyone's electrical needs.

                <dd>
                    Entergy’s program is an easy and convenient way to provide outdoor lighting for your home or business.
                    For a low monthly fee, Entergy installs, maintains and makes repairs and replacements to outdoor security

                <dt class="collapsed">How much does it cost?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Each project varies, based on the individual customer’s needs. Pricing varies depending on the style of
                    light, wattage, and installation costs.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">What type of lights do you offer?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Entergy offers high-quality, utility-grade outdoor lighting. Entergy has high-pressure sodium and
                    metal halide lights as well as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) available in various wattages.
                    (LED lighting might not be available in your region. See our Entergy Security Lighting Tool above for more information ).
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Where does Entergy install lighting?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Entergy will install lighting on Entergy utility poles. Entergy’s lighting group also assists customers
                    with determining installation of decorative lighting and individual poles. Entergy will not install or
                    affix lighting fixtures on a customer’s home or commercial buildings.

                <dt class="collapsed">Is there any upfront cost with Entergy Lights?</dt>
                <dd>
                    There is no upfront installation cost for most lighting projects. Some areas within Entergy’s service
                    territory may require a low-cost installation. In others, the installation cost is built into the monthly
                    fee. Entergy’s lighting representatives will provide specific information for your area.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Is the electricity included in the cost of the light?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes. With all Entergy lights, the electricity with a fixed KWH consumption per month is included in the
                    monthly price of the light. The fuel component of the electric rate is included in the monthly bill, as
                    it is with all our electricity rates.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Can Entergy install a switch on a pole to control turning the light off and on?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Entergy’s outdoor lighting program provides independent dusk-to-dawn operation of the lights that is
                    operated by a photo cell attached directly to the lighting fixture. There is no need for an additional
                    switch to operate the light. All Entergy security lights are equipped with this automatic system.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Can an installed light face the street?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Typically, the outdoor lighting service directs illumination towards the customer’s home or business. However,
                    Entergy also offers a street light program for illumination of roadways that are part of the local municipality
                    (town, city, county, or parish) responsibility.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Can a light be installed on a pole across the street from a property?</dt>
                <dd>
                    For a low monthly fee that can be added to your current utility bill, Entergy installs, maintains and makes repairs and replacements to outdoor security lights installed on Entergy poles.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">Will you install lighting on a building or a tree? Or can I install my own pole?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Entergy installs outdoor lighting on Entergy owned and maintained utility poles in proximity to the customer’s
                    home or business. Entergy does not attach lighting fixtures to customer’s buildings, premises or their own poles.
                    Customers who need to install a pole for a lighting fixture can request for Entergy to install a pole.
                    The cost of the pole can be added as a monthly fee. Entergy will be responsible for acquiring,
                    installing, maintaining and repairing the utility pole as well as the lighting.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">What if a pole needs to be repaired or replaced?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The fee for the installation of a utility pole for use with a lighting fixture will be billed monthly for
                    as long as the customer requests the light be kept on. This fee covers the ongoing maintenance and repair
                    requirements for the use of the pole. Should the pole ever need to be replaced, Entergy will repair and/or
                    replace the pole at no additional cost to the customer.
                </dd>
                <dt class="collapsed">
                    I have multiple accounts with many lights at my business location. Can I receive one
                    bill that covers all the lights for my business?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes. Entergy will create a lighting only account for your business that consolidates and summarizes the
                    cost of all the outdoor lights installed into a separate bill. The bill will itemize the quantity, type,
                    and monthly costs for all of the outdoor lights located at your business.
                </dd>

                <dd>
                    Customers who reside in multi- family facilities such as apartments, condominiums and townhomes typically

                    I see there are three options for lights: amber, white, and bright white. What’s the difference between these, other than appearance?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Entergy currently offers three types of lighting:

                    <ul>
                        <li>High Pressure Sodium (HPS): often used when asthetics are important. They create a soft  amber glow.</li>
                        <li>
                            Metal Halide (MH): produce clean white light, and are used when visibility and color are equally
                            important to security. They are dependable and attractive.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Light Emitting Diodes (LED): produce a bright white light with little or no light trespass.
                            LED lights improve visibility, provide an enhanced lighting uniformity and color rendering.
                            They require no warm-up time and are not attractive to most insects. LED security lights are available
                            in all Entergy electric distribution areas with the exception of Entergy Texas.
